⭐ Salesforce Mini CRM – Customer Premium Automation

A hands-on Salesforce Admin project built in my Developer Org.
This project demonstrates my ability to design data models, build automation, create email alerts, and structure Salesforce records for real business workflows.

🔹 Project Summary

I built a Mini CRM system inside Salesforce with a custom object called Customer Profile.
This CRM stores customer information and automatically sends an email notification when a customer becomes Premium.

This project shows real Salesforce Admin skills including object customization, automation, and process design.
